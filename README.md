Markdown
===

**UPDATE**
> Apparently, there's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for this sort of thing.  That should've been obvious...

**UPDATE**
> The verification for the tests doesn't seem all that flexible.  It's nice that the answers popup after one attempt though.

> The hints say that there must be at least three *dashes* separating each column but in the solution for **TABLES** there's only two.  Unless, *colons* which are seemingly used for alignment count as *dashes*

This __*Markdown*__ thing seems to be really popular.  I should *probably* know how to do it.

Yes, I am practicing the __*How-To-Markdown*__ skills *here* on this very page.

Currying in Javascript

__*Closures*__ and stuff...

*[Call]* and *[Apply]* are also used it seems.
