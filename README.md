Markdown
===

**UPDATE**
Apparently, there's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for this sort of thing.  That should've been obvious...

This __*Markdown*__ thing seems to be really popular.  I should *probably* know how to do it.

Yes, I am practicing the __*How-To-Markdown*__ skills *here* on this very page.

- *Skills* learned
  1. *Headings* that use #
  2. *Emphasis* using * and _
  3. *Lists* (Unsorted/Sorted) and Nested Lists
  4. *Links*
  5. *Embedding Images*


Currying in Javascript
===

__*Closures*__ and stuff...

*[Call]* and *[Apply]* are also used it seems.
